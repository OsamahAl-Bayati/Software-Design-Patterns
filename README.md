# Software Design Patterns
For SOFE3650 - Lab#1

### Adapter Pattern:
A garage door manufacturer has built a controller for standard doors that raise and lower at a fixed speed.  They  now  have  manufactured  a  premium  garage  door  that  can  raise  and  lower  at  different  speeds but they want to still use their pre-existing APIs for the standard garage door.
  
### Observer Pattern:
Notify a set of customers registered for notifications from a particular store.
